# Summer-of-Science
This is the repo in which I have uploaded my basic practical applications of neural networks and deep learning for my Summer of Science project.The problem is a binary classification problem which needs to find whether a customer will stay or leave the telecom service with the help of the data provided.<br/>
The dataset has been taken from kaggle and I have taken the help of the course on udemy named Deep Learning A-Z for the above project.
